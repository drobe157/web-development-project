        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Dalton Roberts. I'm 24 and less than a year away from graduating college! I love playing guitar and jamming with friends.
            Occasionally, I like to play video games with my friends, but that's for when I really have time to kill!
            <br /><br />Helping me make this website that much more attractive is my buddy Rocky!
            He's 5 years old, and full of joy. He loves walks, fetch, and naps. Personally, I'd vote him the best napping buddy you can find!
            <br /><br />
            I hope to graduate in Fall of 2025. When I do, I plan to take time to travel and see some of the world. 
            After that, I will settle down and begin my career. 
        </p>
